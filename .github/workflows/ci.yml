          cache: 'npm' # Cache dependencies to speed up subsequent runs

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci # 'npm ci' is faster and more reliable than 'npm install' for CI

      # Step 4: Run tests (if you have them)
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test -- --watchAll=false # Assuming your package.json has a 'test' script

      # Step 5: Build the Health Monitoring Tool
      - name: Build Application
        run: npm run build # Assuming your package.json has a 'build' script
